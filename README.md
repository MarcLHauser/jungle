### the jungle
##### Game written by Sammy H (based on the book by Upton Sinclair). Thanks to [John Larsen](http://www.room51.co.uk/) for his assistance.  His [book](https://www.manning.com/books/get-programming-with-javascript) is excellent.

Functions named yes() and no() have been renamed to a() and b().  

Questions that previously required simple "yes or no" responses now require the user to "choose a) or b) ".

For instance, the user is now asked, "Do you a) stay in Lithuania, or b) go to America?"

If the user types a(), "You freeze to death because of Lithuania's cold climate."
