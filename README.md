### the jungle
##### Game written by Sammy H (based on the book by Upton Sinclair). Thanks to [John Larsen](http://www.room51.co.uk/) for his assistance.  His [book](https://www.manning.com/books/get-programming-with-javascript) is excellent.

Function named  yes() and no() changed to a() and b().  

Questions changed from simple "yes or no" to "choose a) or b) ".

For instance, when asked 
"Do you a) stay in Lithuania, or b) go to America?"

if the user types a(), "You freeze to death because of Lithuania's cold climate."
